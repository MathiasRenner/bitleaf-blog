I am a foreigner. I am also over fifty years old, meaning, I am of a generation not always familiar with the latest technology. Mathias Renner has continually and patiently helped me in many aspects of home-office technology, including design and construction of an internal network. For more than a decade, I have found Mathias to be always fair; trustworthy; responsive to short-term, unexpected situations; and knowledgeable about all dimensions of IT necessary for a small firm. His command of English is also exceptional.
